                During my freshman year at Affton High School, I took the course 'Computer Science Essentials'. In the course we learned Python block coding, Python Scripting, and we learned how to program robots using block code.

            <p>
                When I was a sophomore, I took the AP course 'Computer Science Principles'. It continued with Python coding, where we learned more in depth code. We created games as our final to the winter semester. My game was a choose your own adventure game with the story line that my friend had created.

            <p>
                When I was a junior, I was online due to Covid-19. I was taking a course that Affton was able to have through the company 'Launch into Code'. Due to the course being considered a beginners class, and I had already taken 2 years of Computer Science, my teacher had me and a few others in my class begin learning the second semester of the class early instead. The second semester was about learning HTML and CSS.

            <p>
                As I am going through my senior year of high school, I enrolled in a program called St. Louis Center for Professional Advanced Studies (STL CAPS). We are working with employees from a St. Louis Company called 'Oasis', where they are teaching us how to code using HTML, CSS, and soon JavaScript.
