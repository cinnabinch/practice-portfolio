            <h1>My Portfolio</h1>
            <p>My first ever web design project that I have done was actually this website. 
                I am making this portfolio in CAPS so I can use it as something I can refer to when meeting with people who want to learn more about me. </p>

            <h1>The Bloom Box</h1>
            <p>For CAPS, we competed in the SM Wilson Centennial Idea Competition. 
                Our prompt for the competition was to make a project that will encourage students from k-12 to get involved in STEAM. 
                I was the project leader for my group, and we created an activity for students in 8-12th grade where they will build garden boxes and decorate them to create a story. 
                We ended up winning a $1,000 award from this project. </p>

        <div>
            <h1>BizFitz</h1>
            <p>Another project we did for CAPS was a competition called "Battle of the Saints". Our prompt was to make a project/business that solves an issue. Our business was called BizFitz and it is an online business where we take thrifted clothings and make it into affordable and stylish business clothing.</p>
